In Kubernetes, `apiGroups` is used to specify the group of resources that the `Role` or `ClusterRole` can access. Each resource in Kubernetes belongs to a particular API group, and `apiGroups: [""]` refers specifically to the **core API group**, which contains fundamental resources that have no prefix in their names.

### Understanding `apiGroups`

1. **Core API Group (`apiGroups: [""]`)**: 
   - When `apiGroups: [""]` is specified, it refers to the **core API group** in Kubernetes, which includes fundamental resources like `pods`, `services`, `configmaps`, `secrets`, `persistentvolumes`, and `persistentvolumeclaims`.
   - The core API group does not have a specific prefix (like `apps` or `networking.k8s.io`), so an empty string `[""]` is used to refer to it.

2. **Other API Groups (e.g., `apps`, `networking.k8s.io`)**: 
   - These are additional API groups introduced to extend Kubernetes functionality. 
   - For instance:
     - `apps` includes resources related to applications, like `deployments` and `replicasets`.
     - `networking.k8s.io` includes network-related resources, such as `ingress`.

### What Does `apiGroups: ["", "apps", "networking.k8s.io"]` Mean?

In your example, specifying `apiGroups: ["", "apps", "networking.k8s.io"]` means the role is granted permissions to resources across three API groups:
   - `""` (core group): For core resources like `pods` and `services`.
   - `apps`: For resources like `deployments` and `replicasets`.
   - `networking.k8s.io`: For network resources like `ingress`.

This way, the role covers a range of resources across different groups.

### Example Explanation for Your Role

In your `Role` definition:

```yaml
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "apps", "networking.k8s.io"]
  resources: ["pods", "deployments", "replicasets", "nodes", "ingress", "services"]
  verbs: ["get", "update", "list", "create", "delete"]
```

1. **`apiGroups: [""]`**: Grants access to core resources (`pods`, `nodes`, `services`) that are part of the core group.
2. **`apiGroups: ["apps"]`**: Grants access to application-related resources (`deployments`, `replicasets`) in the `apps` group.
3. **`apiGroups: ["networking.k8s.io"]`**: Grants access to network resources, such as `ingress`, in the `networking.k8s.io` group.
   
Together, this `Role` gives `user1` permissions to `get`, `update`, `list`, `create`, and `delete` these resources across the specified API groups.

### Differences Between `kubectl api-resources` and `apiGroups`

- **`kubectl api-resources`** shows a list of all available resources in your cluster, including their API groups and whether they’re namespaced.
- **`apiGroups`** in a `Role` or `ClusterRole` refers to the groups that the role should be applied to.

In short, `apiGroups: [""]` specifically targets resources in the core API group, and without it, core resources wouldn’t be accessible in that role configuration.
