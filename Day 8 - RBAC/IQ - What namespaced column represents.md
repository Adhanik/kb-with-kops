The `NAMESPACED` column in `kubectl api-resources` shows whether a particular Kubernetes resource is **namespaced** or **non-namespaced**.

### What is a Namespace in Kubernetes?
A **namespace** in Kubernetes is a way to divide cluster resources logically, allowing for isolated environments within the same cluster. This helps when you want different teams, projects, or environments (like `dev` and `prod`) to share the same cluster but keep their resources separate and independent.

### Understanding the `NAMESPACED` Column

- **Namespaced resources (`true`)**: These resources exist within a specific namespace, meaning you’ll have separate instances of these resources for each namespace. For example:
  - **Pods**, **ConfigMaps**, and **PersistentVolumeClaims** are namespaced resources.
  - If you create a pod in the `dev` namespace, it will only exist in that namespace and won’t be accessible from other namespaces (e.g., `prod`).
  - You can create multiple instances of the same resource in different namespaces. For instance, a `ConfigMap` named `app-config` could exist in both `dev` and `prod` namespaces, but they would be isolated from each other.

- **Non-namespaced resources (`false`)**: These resources are cluster-wide and do not belong to any specific namespace. They are shared across the entire cluster. For example:
  - **Nodes** and **PersistentVolumes** are non-namespaced resources.
  - A **Node** represents a physical or virtual machine in the cluster and is inherently part of the whole cluster, not limited to a specific namespace.
  - Non-namespaced resources are typically foundational to the entire cluster’s infrastructure, so they are available to all namespaces.

### Examples from Your List

| NAME                      | NAMESPACED | KIND                   | Description |
|---------------------------|------------|------------------------|-------------|
| `bindings`                | true       | Binding                | Tied to a specific pod scheduling in a namespace. |
| `componentstatuses`       | false      | ComponentStatus        | Status of cluster components (e.g., API server, scheduler) across the cluster. |
| `configmaps`              | true       | ConfigMap              | Stores configuration data, isolated per namespace. |
| `namespaces`              | false      | Namespace              | Namespace itself is a cluster-wide resource. |
| `nodes`                   | false      | Node                   | Cluster nodes, shared across namespaces. |
| `persistentvolumeclaims`  | true       | PersistentVolumeClaim  | Requests for storage, specific to each namespace. |
| `persistentvolumes`       | false      | PersistentVolume       | Cluster-wide storage resources, available across namespaces. |

### Why Namespacing Matters

Namespacing allows teams and applications to coexist in the same Kubernetes cluster without interference. With namespaced resources:
- You can apply **RBAC policies** at the namespace level, limiting user access to specific namespaces and resources.
- It simplifies the management of resources by providing isolated environments (e.g., dev, test, prod) in the same cluster.
  
In contrast, cluster-wide resources like Nodes and PersistentVolumes are essential to the entire infrastructure and don’t need separate instances per namespace.

### Accessing Namespaced Resources

When working with namespaced resources, you need to specify the namespace if it’s not the default one:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n dev   # Retrieves pods in the 'dev' namespace
kubectl get pods -n prod  # Retrieves pods in the 'prod' namespace
```

Non-namespaced resources, however, don’t require any namespace specification:
```bash
kubectl get nodes         # Retrieves all nodes in the cluster
```
