# RBAC IN ACTION

Now that we have created USER, configured Roles, and created role bindings, the only things left is to check access.


## Login to your master node

We will see the default acton first when i have not set to CONFIG any user

```
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in default namespace.
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods -n development
No resources found in development namespace.
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   4h34m
development       Active   4h18m
kube-node-lease   Active   4h34m
kube-public       Active   4h34m
kube-system       Active   4h34m
production        Active   4h17m

```
Now i am setting my config to USER2. We can see USER2 cannot access development, and ns. for ns, we get error as ns is not specific to resource level, it is applied on cluster level.

```
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ export KUBECONFIG=/home/ubuntu/USER2-CONFIG
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in production namespace.
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods -n development
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "user2" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "development"
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods -n production
No resources found in production namespace.
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get ns
Error from server (Forbidden): namespaces is forbidden: User "user2" cannot list resource "namespaces" in API group "" at the cluster scope
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ 
```

We will create pods now in production ns.

`kubectl create deployment productionpods --image nginx --replicas 6`

```
kubectl create deployment productionpods --image nginx --replicas 6
deployment.apps/productionpods created
```

We can see pods are up and running

```
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

productionpods-66d5fc66dd-zzqjj   1/1     Running   0          17s
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ 
```
For development, it gives us this error. This is because we have set - export KUBECONFIG=/home/ubuntu/USER2-CONFIG for user2.

```
kubectl get pods -n development
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "user2" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "development"
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ 
```

### Development user

We can do same for development user

`export KUBECONFIG=/home/ubuntu/USER1-CONFIG`

```
export KUBECONFIG=/home/ubuntu/USER1-CONFIG
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods
No resources found in development namespace.
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl create deployment developmentpods --image nginx --replicas 1
deployment.apps/developmentpods created
```

If we try to get production pods we get error.

```
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods 
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
developmentpods-5c665cbdb6-lt86b   1/1     Running   0          13s
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ kubectl get pods -n production
Error from server (Forbidden): pods is forbidden: User "user1" cannot list resource "pods" in API group "" in the namespace "production"
ubuntu@i-0e16a40ec029a68a8:~$ 
```
