## How to install - This has to be done on management server

Goto - https://github.com/portainer/k8s

Using NodePort on a local/remote cluster

`kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/portainer/k8s/master/deploy/manifests/portainer/portainer.yaml`

We will see a new ns created for portainer.
```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-90-79:~$ kubectl get ns
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   5h57m
development       Active   5h41m
kube-node-lease   Active   5h57m
kube-public       Active   5h57m
kube-system       Active   5h57m
portainer         Active   8s
production        Active   5h40m
ubuntu@ip-172-31-90-79:~$ 

```

We will see on which port it is running

```
kubectl get svc -n portainer
NAME        TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                                         AGE
portainer   NodePort   100.66.77.158   <none>        9000:30777/TCP,9443:30779/TCP,30776:30776/TCP   63s
ubuntu@ip-172-31-90-79:~$ 

```

We will add these ports in master node S.G and then access it on public ip of master node
