# üîç kOps vs. EKS: Key Differences

| Feature              | kOps (Kubernetes Operations)                               | EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)                     |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Control Plane Management** | You self-manage the control plane on EC2 instances.   | AWS fully manages the control plane.                 |
| **Worker Nodes**      | You need to manage EC2 instances for worker nodes.        | AWS manages the control plane, but you manage the worker nodes. |
| **Networking**        | Uses Calico, Cilium, or Amazon VPC CNI for networking.    | Uses Amazon VPC CNI for networking.                  |
| **High Availability** | You must set up multi-master nodes manually.              | AWS handles multi-AZ HA automatically.               |
| **Scaling**           | Manual or automated with Cluster Autoscaler.              | AWS Auto Scaling supports dynamic scaling.           |
| **Upgrades**          | Manual upgrades of the cluster and nodes.                 | AWS automates Kubernetes version upgrades.          |
| **Cost**              | Cheaper (only pay for EC2, ELB, and storage).            | More expensive (AWS charges for EKS control plane).  |
| **Flexibility**       | More control over configurations, IAM, and storage.      | Less control, but simpler to manage.                 |

## üí° When to Use kOps vs. EKS?

- **Use kOps if:**
  - ‚úÖ You want full control over your Kubernetes setup.
  - ‚úÖ You are comfortable managing nodes, networking, and upgrades.
  - ‚úÖ You need a cost-effective self-managed cluster.

- **Use EKS if:**
  - ‚úÖ You prefer AWS to manage the control plane & upgrades.
  - ‚úÖ You want seamless AWS integration with IAM, ALB, and VPC.
  - ‚úÖ You need a fully managed Kubernetes experience.

## üöÄ If You Are Using kOps:

Since you already have a kOps-managed Kubernetes cluster, you do not need EKS.

Instead, you can install the EBS CSI driver and use a StorageClass for dynamic volume provisioning.
