# DaemonSet Scheduling, Taints, and Scaling

## Scenario 1: Taints on Nodes

- If a node has a taint, the DaemonSet will not be scheduled on that node unless the DaemonSet’s pod has a corresponding toleration.
- If the DaemonSet has a matching toleration, then it can still be scheduled on the tainted node.

## Scenario 2: Node Affinity with `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`

- Preferred node affinity (`preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`) is a soft rule.
- This means that the scheduler tries to place the pod on preferred nodes, but if necessary, it can still schedule it on other nodes.
- So, DaemonSet pods can still be scheduled on nodes even if they don’t match the preferred affinity condition.

## Final Answer

- If a node has a taint, the DaemonSet won’t be scheduled there unless the DaemonSet pod has a matching toleration.
- If a node has only preferred node affinity, it won’t stop the DaemonSet from being deployed—it just influences placement preference.
- The DaemonSet will still be deployed on all non-tainted nodes, regardless of preferred affinity.
- If there are nodes with a taint and no toleration in the DaemonSet, the DaemonSet will not deploy there.

Let me know if you need a practical example with YAML!
