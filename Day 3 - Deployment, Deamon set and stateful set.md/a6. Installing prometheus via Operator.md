## Via Operator

### Yes! You are noticing the difference between two ways of installing the Prometheus Operator, and both approaches are valid. Let‚Äôs break it down.

### Approach 1: Install Prometheus Operator Manually (kubectl-based)

This is the method I shared earlier, where you:

1. Manually deploy the Prometheus Operator as a Deployment.
2. Manually apply the CRDs (Prometheus, ServiceMonitor, etc.).
3. Manually create Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana.

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- Gives full control over Prometheus deployment.
- Works in any Kubernetes cluster, including vanilla Kubernetes.
- Easier for self-managed clusters (e.g., bare metal, minikube).

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:
- More manual steps to manage lifecycle (upgrades, scaling, etc.).
- Requires you to manually manage Prometheus updates.

---

### Approach 2: Install Prometheus Operator via Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) from OperatorHub

This approach uses the Operator Framework to install and manage Prometheus automatically.

#### How it Works?

1. **Install the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM):**
   - OLM is a Kubernetes component that manages operators.
   - You install it once per cluster.

2. **Install the Prometheus Operator from OperatorHub:**
   - Prometheus Operator gets installed via OLM instead of a Deployment.
   - This automatically installs and manages CRDs (Prometheus, Alertmanager, etc.).

3. **Create a PrometheusInstance CRD:**
   - Instead of manually deploying Prometheus, you just create a CR (Custom Resource), and OLM deploys everything.

#### ‚úÖ Advantages:
- Fully automated management (OLM handles updates, upgrades, and dependencies).
- Best for cloud-managed Kubernetes (e.g., OpenShift, AWS EKS, Azure AKS).
- Easier lifecycle management (OLM manages CRDs, rolling updates, versioning).

#### ‚ùå Disadvantages:
- Requires OLM (not always available in vanilla Kubernetes).
- Less control (some configurations might be pre-defined by the operator).

## Which One Should You Use?

| **Scenario**                             | **Recommended Approach**        |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Self-managed Kubernetes** (e.g., K3s, Minikube, Bare Metal) | Manual Installation (kubectl apply) |
| **Cloud-managed Kubernetes** (EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift) | OperatorHub + OLM              |

- **You need full control over Prometheus setup** ‚Üí **Manual Installation (kubectl apply)**
- **You want easy upgrades and lifecycle management** ‚Üí **OperatorHub + OLM**

## Step-by-Step

: Installing Prometheus Operator via OperatorHub (OLM)

If you want to use the OperatorHub/OLM method, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Install Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

```bash
curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/latest/download/install.sh | bash -s 0.26.0
```

üìå **This installs OLM (required for OperatorHub operators).**

#### Verify OLM installation:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n olm
```

You should see **olm-operator**, **catalog-operator**, and **packageserver** running.

### Step 2: Install Prometheus Operator from OperatorHub

Now, apply the Prometheus Operator Subscription YAML:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: prometheus-operator-subscription
  namespace: operators  # OLM installs Operators here
spec:
  channel: stable
  name: prometheus
  source: operatorhubio-catalog
  sourceNamespace: olm
```

üìå **This tells OLM to install the Prometheus Operator.**

#### Check if the operator is installed:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n operators
```

You should see something like:

```bash
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-7d5f9b7c99-lvgrh      1/1     Running   0          1m
```

### Step 3: Create a Prometheus Instance Using CRD

Once the Prometheus Operator is installed via OLM, you just create a Prometheus resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: my-prometheus
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  replicas: 2
  serviceMonitorSelector: {}  # Automatically scrapes all ServiceMonitors
```

üìå **The Operator will now create Prometheus for you!**

### Step 4: Verify Installation

Check if Prometheus is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n monitoring
```

You should see:

```bash
NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-my-prometheus-0              2/2     Running   0          1m
prometheus-my-prometheus-1              2/2     Running   0          1m
```

üöÄ **Now, Prometheus is fully managed by the Operator!**

## Final Comparison: Which Approach Should You Use?

| **Feature**               | **Manual Installation (kubectl apply)** | **OperatorHub + OLM**       |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Ease of Setup**          | ‚ùå Manual steps required               | ‚úÖ Fully automated          |
| **Cluster Type**           | ‚úÖ Works on any cluster                | ‚ùå Requires OLM support     |
| **Upgrades & Lifecycle**   | ‚ùå Manual updates                      | ‚úÖ OLM auto-updates         |
| **Customization**          | ‚úÖ Full control                        | ‚ùå Limited control          |
| **Best for**               | Self-managed clusters                 | Cloud-managed Kubernetes    |

üöÄ **If you are using OpenShift, EKS, or AKS ‚Üí Use OLM (OperatorHub).**

üõ† **If you are using Minikube, Bare Metal ‚Üí Use Manual Installation.**

---

## Conclusion

- Both methods work, but OLM-based installation is more automated and cloud-friendly.
- If you need full control, prefer manual installation using kubectl apply.
- If you want automatic upgrades and management, use OperatorHub (OLM).
