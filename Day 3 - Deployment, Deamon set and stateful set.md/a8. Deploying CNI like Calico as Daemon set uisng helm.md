# Installing Calico (CNI) via Helm and Operator Method

Calico is a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for Kubernetes that provides networking and network security features. It is typically deployed as a DaemonSet since every node in the cluster needs the Calico agent (`calico-node`) to manage networking.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installing Calico Using Helm

While Calico is traditionally installed using `kubectl apply -f`, there is also a Helm chart available for deploying Calico components.

### Step 1: Add the Calico Helm Repository

```bash
helm repo add projectcalico https://docs.tigera.io/calico/charts
helm repo update
```

### Step 2: Install Calico Using Helm

```bash
helm install calico projectcalico/tigera-operator --namespace calico-system --create-namespace
```

üìå **This installs the Calico Operator, which then deploys Calico components (including DaemonSets like `calico-node`).**

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
kubectl get pods -n calico-system
```

Expected output:

```bash
NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
calico-kube-controllers-5bb476ff8f-tdgcl   1/1     Running   0          1m
calico-node-4m89n                          1/1     Running   0          1m
calico-node-7b92x                          1/1     Running   0          1m
calico-typha-7f8b9894ff-mn26k              1/1     Running   0          1m
```

üöÄ **Calico is now running on all nodes as a DaemonSet!**

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Can Calico Be Installed Using an Operator?

Yes! Calico is actually deployed using an operator, even though it‚Äôs not available in OperatorHub. When you install Calico via Helm (tigera-operator), you‚Äôre deploying the Calico Operator, which then sets up Calico components like `calico-node` as a DaemonSet.

üìå **So why isn‚Äôt Calico in OperatorHub?**

- Calico has its own operator (`tigera-operator`), which is provided by Tigera (the company behind Calico).
- Only operators explicitly added to OperatorHub appear there. Since Tigera maintains its own Helm chart for the operator, they have not added it to OperatorHub.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Helm vs Operator for Calico?

| **Method**                  | **Helm (tigera-operator)** | **Manual YAML (kubectl apply)** |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Ease of Installation**     | ‚úÖ Easy                    | ‚ùå More manual steps           |
| **Upgrades**                 | ‚úÖ `helm upgrade` simplifies updates | ‚ùå Manual updates             |
| **Best for**                 | Kubernetes clusters needing automated installation | Custom installations         |

üìå **If you want automated installation** ‚Üí **Use Helm (which deploys the Calico Operator).**  
üìå **If you want full control** ‚Üí **Use `kubectl apply` with YAML manifests.**

## Final Thoughts

- **Calico can be installed via Helm**, which deploys the Calico Operator.
- **Calico‚Äôs Operator is not in OperatorHub**, but it works similarly.
- **DaemonSets** are used for networking tools like Calico because they need to run on every node.
