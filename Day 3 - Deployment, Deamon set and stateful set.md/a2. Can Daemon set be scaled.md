# Scaling in DaemonSets and Handling Pod Failures

## 1. Behavior of DaemonSets in Case of a Pod Failure

- When a DaemonSet pod crashes or is removed from a node, the Kubernetes DaemonSet controller automatically recreates it on the same node.
- However, there will be a temporary gap in data collection or functionality until the pod is rescheduled and running again.
- Unlike Deployments, which have a replica count, DaemonSets ensure exactly one pod per node (by default).

## 2. Can You Schedule Multiple DaemonSet Pods per Node?

Yes! You can deploy multiple DaemonSets with different labels or configurations, so each node runs multiple pods from different DaemonSets. However, if you want two pods from the same DaemonSet on each node, that is not directly supported.

## 3. Workarounds for Running Multiple DaemonSet Pods per Node

If you want redundancy (e.g., running two pods per node for resilience), consider these options:

### 1. Run Two Separate DaemonSets

- Deploy two separate DaemonSets with different labels or pod specs but running the same application.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: daemonset-1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
        instance: "1"
```

- Deploy another DaemonSet with `instance: "2"` so each node gets two pods.

### 2. Use a StatefulSet Instead

- If you need redundancy and persistence, a StatefulSet with node affinity can help.
- However, this won’t automatically place one pod on every node like a DaemonSet does.

### 3. Run a Single DaemonSet with Pod Anti-Affinity

- Use a single DaemonSet but configure it to allow multiple pods per node using `PodAntiAffinity`.
- This approach is tricky because DaemonSets, by default, ensure only one pod per node.

## 4. Key Trade-offs

- **Multiple DaemonSets** → Works well but increases resource usage.
- **StatefulSet with node affinity** → More flexible but doesn’t guarantee “one per node” behavior.
- **Single DaemonSet with Anti-Affinity** → Complex and not always effective.

## Conclusion

- A DaemonSet automatically recovers a crashed pod, but data loss can occur until it restarts.
- You cannot natively run multiple pods per node in the same DaemonSet.
- If you need redundancy, deploy two DaemonSets with different labels or consider other workload types like StatefulSets.
