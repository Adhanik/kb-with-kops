# Common Use Cases of DaemonSets

DaemonSets are primarily used for deploying workloads that must run on every node in a Kubernetes cluster. They are ideal for node-specific tasks, such as monitoring, logging, networking, and security.

## 1. Logging and Monitoring Agents

DaemonSets are commonly used to collect logs and metrics from every node in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Use Case: Centralized Logging

- Tools like Fluentd, Filebeat, and Logstash collect and forward logs from nodes to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk, Loki).
- A DaemonSet ensures that each node has an agent running, collecting logs from containers, system logs, etc.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Deploying Fluentd as a DaemonSet to collect logs from all nodes and send them to Elasticsearch.

## 2. Node Monitoring & Metrics Collection

DaemonSets are used to monitor node-level resource usage and provide insights into CPU, memory, and network activity.

### Use Case: System Monitoring with Prometheus Node Exporter

- Prometheus Node Exporter is deployed as a DaemonSet to collect system metrics from each node (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network).
- The collected data is then visualized in Grafana for monitoring.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Running Node Exporter as a DaemonSet ensures that every node provides resource metrics to Prometheus.

## 3. Networking & Service Mesh Proxies

DaemonSets are used for networking components like CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins and service mesh proxies.

### Use Case: Running a CNI Plugin

- Kubernetes networking plugins like Calico, Flannel, Cilium use DaemonSets to run networking daemons on every node.
- This ensures proper pod-to-pod communication and network policies.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Deploying Calico as a DaemonSet so every node manages its own network policies and routes traffic correctly.

### Use Case: Service Mesh Sidecars (Istio, Linkerd, Cilium)

- Service meshes like Istio or Linkerd use DaemonSets to run sidecar proxies or control plane components on each node.
- This enables secure communication between microservices.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Istioâ€™s CNI plugin runs as a DaemonSet to ensure network policies are applied at the node level.

## 4. Security and Compliance Agents

DaemonSets help enforce security policies across all nodes.

### Use Case: Security & Compliance Enforcement

- Security tools like Falco, Sysdig, and AppArmor run as DaemonSets to monitor system calls and detect threats.
- They help in real-time intrusion detection and enforcing compliance policies (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Running Falco as a DaemonSet to detect suspicious activities, like unauthorized process executions.

## 5. Storage Management & Volume Provisioning

DaemonSets are used for storage management when nodes need persistent storage access.

### Use Case: Running a CSI (Container Storage Interface) Plugin

- Storage solutions like Ceph, OpenEBS, Rook use DaemonSets to attach and manage storage volumes across nodes.
- This ensures persistent volumes (PVs) are mounted correctly for applications.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Running OpenEBS as a DaemonSet to enable dynamic storage provisioning for Kubernetes workloads.

## 6. Load Balancing & Ingress Controllers

DaemonSets can be used to deploy node-local load balancers and ingress controllers.

### Use Case: Running MetalLB or Node Local DNS Cache

- MetalLB is a load balancer for Kubernetes clusters without cloud-based load balancers.
- It runs as a DaemonSet to provide external IP addresses to services.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Deploying MetalLB as a DaemonSet to assign external IPs to services in a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster.

## 7. High-Performance Computing (HPC) & GPU/FPGA Workloads

DaemonSets are used in AI/ML workloads that require specialized hardware like GPUs or FPGAs.

### Use Case: GPU Daemons for AI/ML Workloads

- AI workloads (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) require GPU management tools like NVIDIA GPU Operator.
- DaemonSets are used to deploy NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA runtime on every node.

ðŸ“Œ **Example**: Running NVIDIA GPU Operator as a DaemonSet so ML workloads can access GPUs efficiently.

| Networking              | Calico, Flannel, Cilium    | Manage network policies & CNI plugins         |
| Security                | Falco, Sysdig, AppArmor    | Monitor system calls & enforce security policies |
| Storage                 | OpenEBS, Rook, Ceph        | Manage storage provisioning                   |
| Load Balancing          | MetalLB, NodeLocalDNS      | Assign external IPs & optimize DNS           |
| AI/ML Workloads         | NVIDIA GPU Operator        | Enable GPU acceleration for ML workloads     |

## Conclusion

DaemonSets are critical for Kubernetes clusters because they ensure system-wide consistency by running essential services on all nodes. They are widely used for logging, monitoring, security, networking, storage, and AI workloads.
