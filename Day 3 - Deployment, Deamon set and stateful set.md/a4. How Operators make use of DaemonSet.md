# Clarifying Your Understanding: Operators vs DaemonSets

Youâ€™re mostly correct, but letâ€™s refine your understanding.

## 1. Operators vs DaemonSets: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

| **Feature**         | **Operators**                                     | **DaemonSets**                            |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use**      | Manage complex, stateful applications (e.g., Prometheus, databases) | Ensure pods run on every node (e.g., logging, monitoring agents) |
| **Resource Type**    | Uses CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and Controllers | Uses Pods & Nodes directly               |
| **Pod Management**   | Can create Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets  | Creates one pod per node                 |
| **Scaling**          | Manages replica counts dynamically                | Automatically deploys to all nodes       |
| **Example Use Case** | Prometheus Operator manages Prometheus instances  | Node Exporter DaemonSet collects node metrics |

## 2. Prometheus & Operators vs DaemonSets

âœ… You are right that Prometheus itself is managed via an Operator.

- The Prometheus Operator installs Prometheus as a StatefulSet (because it needs persistent storage).
- The operator automates tasks like upgrading, scaling, and managing Prometheus instances.

âœ… But Prometheus Node Exporter runs as a DaemonSet.

- Prometheus Node Exporter runs on every node to collect CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics.
- Since it needs to run on all nodes, it is deployed as a DaemonSet, not a StatefulSet.

## 3. What You Were Missing

Your understanding was mostly correct, but the key difference is:

- **Operators manage StatefulSets** (like Prometheus itself).
- **DaemonSets ensure per-node presence** (like Node Exporter).
- **Operators can create DaemonSets!** (e.g., Prometheus Operator can deploy Node Exporter as a DaemonSet).

## 4. YAML Example: Prometheus Node Exporter as a DaemonSet

Since Prometheus Node Exporter must run on every node, we deploy it as a DaemonSet:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: node-exporter
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    app: node-exporter
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-exporter
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-exporter
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-exporter
        image: prom/node-exporter:v1.6.0  # Latest Node Exporter image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9100  # Exposes metrics on this port
        resources:
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 128Mi
          limits:
            cpu: 200m
            memory: 256Mi
      hostNetwork: true  # Needed for access to host network metrics
```

ðŸ“Œ **Explanation:**

- This DaemonSet ensures Node Exporter runs on every node.
- It exposes metrics on port 9100, which Prometheus scrapes.
- `hostNetwork: true` ensures it can access host-level metrics.

## 5. Final Thoughts

- **Prometheus Operator** â†’ Manages StatefulSet (Prometheus Server)
- **DaemonSet** â†’ Ensures Prometheus Node Exporter runs on every node
- **Operators can create DaemonSets** (e.g., Prometheus Operator installs Node Exporter)
