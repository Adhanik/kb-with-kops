## Diff in above command
The two commands you mentioned have slightly different forms, but they essentially achieve the same result, with a few differences related to how Kubernetes handles API resources:

### 1. **`kubectl delete deployments testpod1`**
   - **`deployments`** is a shorthand for `deployments.apps`.
   - By default, Kubernetes deployments are part of the **`apps/v1` API group**, which is the standard API version for managing deployments.
   - This command deletes the **`testpod1`** deployment in the current namespace.

### 2. **`kubectl delete deployments.apps`**
   - **`deployments.apps`** explicitly specifies the **API group** (`apps` API group) where the `Deployment` resource belongs.
   - The **`apps`** API group was introduced to handle resources like deployments and stateful sets in a more structured way. Even though `Deployment` used to be part of the `extensions/v1beta1` API group, it's now part of `apps/v1`.

### Key Differences:
1. **API Group Specification**:
   - `kubectl delete deployments` omits the API group and uses the default (`apps/v1`) under the hood.
   - `kubectl delete deployments.apps` explicitly includes the API group (`apps`), which can sometimes be necessary if there are multiple API versions available for the resource.

2. **Effectiveness**:
   - Both commands delete the same **`Deployment`** resource (in this case, `testpod1`).
   - Since deployments are typically managed by the `apps/v1` API group, both forms work the same way in most practical scenarios.

3. **Portability**:
   - Using **`deployments.apps`** makes it clearer which API group the resource belongs to, especially if you're working in an environment where API groups matter more (e.g., if you're working with multiple API versions or in clusters that may still have older API groups).

### When should you use one over the other?
- **`kubectl delete deployments`**: This is the simpler and more common way to manage deployments, and it's suitable for most cases.
- **`kubectl delete deployments.apps`**: You might use this if you're being explicit about API groups (e.g., in complex or legacy clusters) or if you are managing resources that might be available in multiple API groups.

### Recap:
- **`kubectl delete deployments`**: Deletes a deployment using shorthand (implicitly `apps/v1` API group).
- **`kubectl delete deployments.apps`**: Deletes a deployment with explicit API group specification (`apps/v1`).
  
In modern Kubernetes versions, both commands will behave the same for deployments, but the explicit form (`deployments.apps`) provides more clarity about the API group being used.
