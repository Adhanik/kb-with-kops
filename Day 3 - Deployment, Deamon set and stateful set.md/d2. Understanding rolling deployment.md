The **rolling update** feature in Kubernetes allows you to update the pods of a deployment gradually, ensuring that the service remains available during the update process. This is crucial in production environments where downtime needs to be minimized.

Let's break down the rolling update strategy and its key parameters (`maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable`) with an example:

### Scenario: 
You have **100 pods** running version `v1` of your application across **25 nodes**, and you want to upgrade them to version `v2` using a rolling update.

#### Key Terms:
- **maxSurge**: This controls the maximum number of **extra** pods that can be created during the update, beyond the desired number of replicas.
- **maxUnavailable**: This specifies the maximum number of pods that can be **unavailable** during the update.

### Example Deployment with Rolling Update:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 100
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 10     # Allow up to 10 extra pods to be created during the update
      maxUnavailable: 5 # Allow up to 5 pods to be unavailable during the update
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app:v2 # Upgrading from v1 to v2
```

### How It Works:
1. **Initial State (Before the Update)**:
   - You have 100 pods of version `v1` running across 25 nodes.

2. **Update Triggered**:
   - When you apply the new deployment manifest with version `v2`, Kubernetes will **gradually** replace the `v1` pods with `v2` pods.
   - Kubernetes will control the speed of this update based on the `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` values.

#### Parameters in Action:

- **maxSurge**: 
   - With `maxSurge: 10`, Kubernetes can create up to 10 **extra** pods in addition to the 100 pods. So, at any given point during the update, you could have up to 110 pods (100 existing + 10 new `v2` pods) running.
   - This ensures that some new `v2` pods are running before Kubernetes terminates the old `v1` pods, maintaining service availability.

- **maxUnavailable**:
   - With `maxUnavailable: 5`, at any point, a maximum of 5 pods can be unavailable. This means Kubernetes will take down up to 5 `v1` pods at a time while replacing them with new `v2` pods.
   - Kubernetes will only terminate a pod if it has already created the corresponding new pod or if the number of unavailable pods is still within the limit (in this case, 5).

### Rolling Update Flow:

1. Kubernetes starts by creating up to 10 **new `v2` pods** (because of `maxSurge: 10`).
2. It then **terminates up to 5 `v1` pods** (because of `maxUnavailable: 5`).
3. This process continues in batches:
   - For each batch, Kubernetes creates new `v2` pods (up to 10 at a time) and removes old `v1` pods (up to 5 at a time).
4. This continues until all `v1` pods have been replaced with `v2` pods.

At the end of the update, all 100 pods will be running the new version (`v2`), and the cluster will have 0 pods running the old version (`v1`).

### Visual Representation:
If we start with 100 pods of `v1`:

| Step | `v1` Pods | `v2` Pods | Unavailable Pods |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
| 1    | 100       | 0         | 0                |
| 2    | 95        | 10        | 5                |
| 3    | 90        | 20        | 5                |
| 4    | 85        | 30        | 5                |
| ...  | ...       | ...       | ...              |
| Final| 0         | 100       | 0                |

### Fine-Tuning the Update:
- You can **adjust** `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` to control how aggressively Kubernetes performs the rolling update.
   - **Higher `maxSurge`** means faster deployment with more pods running simultaneously.
   - **Higher `maxUnavailable`** means more pods can be taken down at once, which can speed up the update but increases the risk of service degradation.

### Default Values:
If not specified:
- **maxSurge** defaults to `25%` (i.e., Kubernetes will create up to 25% more pods than the desired number of replicas).
- **maxUnavailable** defaults to `25%` (i.e., Kubernetes will allow up to 25% of pods to be unavailable during the update).

### Conclusion:
The rolling update strategy ensures **high availability** during an update by replacing pods in a controlled and gradual manner, based on your `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` settings. This allows you to balance the speed of updates with the need to maintain availability during the process.
