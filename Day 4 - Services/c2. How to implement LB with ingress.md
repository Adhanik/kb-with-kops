### Key Components in the Setup

1. **Ingress Resource**:
   - An Ingress is a Kubernetes resource that defines rules for routing external HTTP/HTTPS traffic to services inside the cluster.
   - It acts as a configuration layer for routing traffic, but it does not actually handle the traffic itself.

2. **Ingress Controller**:
   - The Ingress Controller is the component that implements the rules defined in the Ingress resource.
   - It is responsible for processing incoming traffic and routing it to the appropriate backend services (Pods).
   - Popular Ingress Controllers include NGINX Ingress Controller, AWS ALB Ingress Controller, Traefik, and others.

3. **Load Balancer**:
   - A Load Balancer (LB) is typically a cloud provider-managed service (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer, Azure Load Balancer) that distributes incoming traffic across multiple backend instances.
   - In Kubernetes, a LoadBalancer-type Service can be used to expose your application to the internet, and it automatically provisions a cloud load balancer.

### How the Setup Works

1. **Ingress Resource**:
   - You define an Ingress resource in your Kubernetes cluster. This resource specifies the hostnames, paths, and backend services to which traffic should be routed.
   - Example:
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
     kind: Ingress
     metadata:
       name: example-ingress
     spec:
       rules:
       - host: example.com
         http:
           paths:
           - path: /app
             pathType: Prefix
             backend:
               service:
                 name: app-service
                 port:
                   number: 80
     ```

2. **Ingress Controller**:
   - The Ingress Controller watches for Ingress resources and configures itself to handle traffic based on the rules defined in the Ingress.
   - The Ingress Controller runs as a Pod in your cluster and is typically exposed to the internet using a **LoadBalancer Service** or **NodePort Service**.

3. **Load Balancer**:
   - When you deploy an Ingress Controller, you usually expose it using a **LoadBalancer Service**. This creates a cloud provider-managed Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer) that routes traffic to the Ingress Controller.
   - The Load Balancer is the entry point for external traffic and forwards it to the Ingress Controller.

4. **Traffic Flow**:
   - External traffic hits the Load Balancer (e.g., AWS ALB).
   - The Load Balancer forwards the traffic to the Ingress Controller Pod(s).
   - The Ingress Controller processes the traffic based on the rules defined in the Ingress resource and routes it to the appropriate backend Service.
   - The backend Service then routes the traffic to the Pods.

### Do You Still Need a Load Balancer with Ingress?

Yes, you still need a Load Balancer when using Ingress in most cloud environments. Here's why:

- The **Ingress Controller** needs to be exposed to the internet so it can receive traffic.
- A **LoadBalancer Service** is the most common way to expose the Ingress Controller to the internet. This automatically provisions a cloud load balancer (e.g., AWS ALB, GCP Load Balancer) that routes traffic to the Ingress Controller.

However, there are some exceptions:
- If you're running Kubernetes on-premises or in an environment without cloud-managed load balancers, you might use a **NodePort Service** or **MetalLB** to expose the Ingress Controller.
- In some cases, you might use a **hostPort** or **hostNetwork** configuration for the Ingress Controller, but this is less common.

### Example Setup with AWS ALB Ingress Controller

1. Deploy the AWS ALB Ingress Controller in your cluster.
2. Create an Ingress resource:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
   kind: Ingress
   metadata:
     name: example-ingress
     annotations:
       kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
   spec:
     rules:
     - host: example.com
       http:
         paths:
         - path: /app
           pathType: Prefix
           backend:
             service:
               name: app-service
               port:
                 number: 80
   ```
3. The AWS ALB Ingress Controller will:
   - Automatically create an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB).
   - Configure the ALB to route traffic to the Ingress Controller Pod(s).
   - Route traffic to the appropriate backend Service based on the Ingress rules.

### Summary

- **Ingress** is a configuration layer for routing traffic.
- **Ingress Controller** implements the Ingress rules and handles traffic routing.
- **Load Balancer** (e.g., AWS ALB) is typically used to expose the Ingress Controller to the internet.
- You still need a Load Balancer in most cloud environments to expose the Ingress Controller, but the Ingress Controller handles the actual routing to backend Pods.
