### **Steps to Implement Passive Logging with Terraform**

#### 1. **Deploy Fluentd as a DaemonSet**
Fluentd will collect logs from each node and forward them to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki).

#### 2. **Deploy Prometheus for Metrics**
Prometheus will collect system and application metrics, and Grafana will visualize them.

#### 3. **Terraform Implementation**

Below is an example Terraform configuration to deploy:
- Fluentd as a DaemonSet for log collection.
- Prometheus for metrics collection.

#### **2. Deploy Fluentd as a DaemonSet**
You can use the **Fluentd Helm chart** to deploy Fluentd as a DaemonSet.


#### **3. Deploy Prometheus and Grafana**
Use the **Prometheus Operator Helm chart** to deploy Prometheus and Grafana.

### **Explanation of the Setup**

1. **Fluentd**:
   - Deployed as a DaemonSet to ensure it runs on every node.
   - Collects logs from `/var/log/containers` (where Kubernetes stores container logs).
   - Forwards logs to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki).

2. **Prometheus**:
   - Deployed using the Prometheus Operator.
   - Collects metrics from nodes, Pods, and services.
   - Visualizes metrics in Grafana.

3. **Grafana**:
   - Automatically deployed with the Prometheus Operator.
   - Used to create dashboards for monitoring metrics.

### **Why Fluentd is Still Needed**
- Prometheus is designed for metrics, not logs. It cannot collect or store logs.
- Fluentd or Fluent Bit is required to collect logs from nodes and forward them to a logging backend.

### **Centralized Logging Backend**
You need a centralized logging backend to store and query logs. Some popular options:
1. **Elasticsearch**: For storing logs and querying them using Kibana.
2. **Loki**: A lightweight logging system designed for Kubernetes, often used with Grafana for visualization.
3. **AWS CloudWatch**: If you're running on AWS.

### **Example: Deploy Loki as a Logging Backend**
If you want to use **Loki** as your logging backend, you can deploy it using Helm:

Then, update the Fluentd configuration to forward logs to Loki:

### **Final Notes**
- Use **Fluentd** or **Fluent Bit** for log collection.
- Use **Prometheus** for metrics collection.
- Deploy both using Terraform for infrastructure-as-code management.
- Ensure your logging backend (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch) is properly configured to receive logs from Fluentd.
