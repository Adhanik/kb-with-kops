We need to understand that **Prometheus** and **Fluentd** both serve different purposes:

1. **Prometheus**: Primarily used for collecting and storing **metrics** (e.g., CPU, memory, disk usage). It does not handle **logs**.
2. **Fluentd/Fluent Bit**: Used for collecting, processing, and forwarding **logs** to a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki).

Since Prometheus cannot handle logs, you will still need a logging agent like **Fluentd** or **Fluent Bit** to collect and forward logs. 

### **Final Notes**
- Use **Fluentd** or **Fluent Bit** for log collection.
- Use **Prometheus** for metrics collection.
- Deploy both using Terraform for infrastructure-as-code management.
- Ensure your logging backend (e.g., Loki, Elasticsearch) is properly configured to receive logs from Fluentd.
