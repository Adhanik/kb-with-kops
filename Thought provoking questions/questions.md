# Thought-Provoking Kubernetes Questions for Real-World Scenarios

These questions will test your deep understanding of Kubernetes, force you to think critically, and prepare you for real-world troubleshooting scenarios.

## üìå DaemonSet & CNI-Related Questions

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Why is Calico (a DaemonSet) required for Kubernetes networking, and what would happen if Calico pods failed?**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **If you deploy a DaemonSet with tolerations, but it‚Äôs not scheduling on tainted nodes, how would you debug the issue?**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **How would you ensure that a critical DaemonSet (e.g., a logging agent) runs only on worker nodes but not on master nodes?**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Can you run two different CNI plugins (e.g., Calico and Flannel) in the same cluster? What would happen if you tried?**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **If a Kubernetes node gets isolated (network partitioned) but its pods are still running, how does this impact a DaemonSet deployed on that node?**

## üìå CRD & Operator-Related Questions

6Ô∏è‚É£ **What happens if you create a CRD but do not have an Operator installed to watch for it?**

7Ô∏è‚É£ **How does an Operator differ from a Deployment in managing stateful applications? Can you replace Operators with Helm?**

8Ô∏è‚É£ **What would happen if a CRD was accidentally deleted from a live cluster? How would you recover applications dependent on it?**

9Ô∏è‚É£ **If an Operator is managing a custom resource and you modify the resource manually, will the Operator overwrite your changes?**

üîü **Can you have multiple Operators watching the same CRD? What conflicts might arise?**

## üìå Helm & Application Management

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **If you install an application using Helm, how do you track which Kubernetes resources belong to that Helm release?**

1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **What happens if a Helm release is deleted but its underlying Kubernetes resources are still running? How would you clean them up?**

1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **If you need to deploy Prometheus, which method would you choose: Operator, Helm, or raw manifests? Why?**

1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **How do Helm hooks work, and how can they be used to run pre-install or post-install tasks for an application?**

1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **If you have a Helm chart for an application and an Operator for the same application, how do you decide which to use?**

## üìå Kubernetes Networking, Kube-Proxy, & iptables

1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ **If a Service has no endpoints (i.e., no backing Pods), what happens when a request is sent to the Service IP?**

1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ **What would happen if kube-proxy is stopped on a worker node? How would traffic routing be impacted?**

1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ **Can a Pod on Node 1 directly communicate with a Pod on Node 2 if the CNI is misconfigured? Why or why not?**

1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ **How does Kubernetes handle load balancing when a Service has multiple Pods? How is this implemented in iptables?**

2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ **What is the difference between ClusterIP and Headless Service in how kube-proxy routes traffic?**

## üìå Troubleshooting & Real-World Scenarios

2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ **A Pod is stuck in ContainerCreating state. How would you debug this issue? What are the possible causes?**

2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ **You have a Service exposed via NodePort, but external users cannot reach it. What steps would you take to troubleshoot?**

2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ **A StatefulSet application is taking too long to start. What Kubernetes and underlying infrastructure factors might be causing this?**

2Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ **If a node suddenly disappears from the cluster, what impact does this have on different types of workloads (DaemonSet, Deployment, StatefulSet, etc.)?**

2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ **How would you detect and debug intermittent packet drops in a Kubernetes cluster?**

---

## üöÄ Bonus: Architecture & Design

2Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ **If you need to deploy a multi-tenant application in Kubernetes, what networking and security measures would you implement?**

2Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ **How would you design a logging solution for a large-scale Kubernetes cluster with thousands of nodes and Pods?**

2Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ **If you need to migrate a running application from one Kubernetes cluster to another with zero downtime, how would you approach it?**

2Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ **How can you use network policies to enforce isolation between different namespaces?**

3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ **When would you choose eBPF-based networking (e.g., Cilium) over traditional iptables-based networking?**
