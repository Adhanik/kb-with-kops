# If i define volumemoutns without specifying volumes, will it still work?

No, if you define `volumeMounts` in a container without defining corresponding `volumes` in the Pod specification, it will not work, and Kubernetes will throw an error. 

The `volumeMounts` section in each container relies on the `volumes` section in the Pod to define the source of that volume. Kubernetes needs both the source (under `volumes`) and the target location in each container (under `volumeMounts`) to successfully mount the volume. If `volumes` are missing, Kubernetes wonâ€™t know where the data is coming from, leading to errors when deploying the Pod. 

To avoid this, always ensure that:
- Every `volumeMount` specified in a container has a corresponding entry in the `volumes` section at the Pod level.
