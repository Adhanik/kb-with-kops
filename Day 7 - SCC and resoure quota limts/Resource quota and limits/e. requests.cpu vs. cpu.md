Both `ResourceQuota` definitions you've provided are valid, but they serve slightly different purposes due to how they’re configured. Here’s an explanation of each and when to use each style:

### 1. ResourceQuota with `requests` and `limits` (First Definition)

This configuration is specifying both **requests** and **limits** for CPU and memory for the entire namespace. Here’s a breakdown:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: object-counts
  namespace: development

spec:
  hard: 
    requests.cpu: "1000m"         # Total CPU requested across all pods
    limits.cpu: "2000m"           # Max CPU limit across all pods
    requests.memory: 1Gi          # Total memory requested across all pods
    limits.memory: 2Gi            # Max memory limit across all pods
    pods: "10"                    # Max number of pods allowed in the namespace
    replicationcontrollers: "20"  # Max number of replication controllers
    resourcequotas: "10"          # Max number of ResourceQuotas allowed
    services: "5"                 # Max number of services allowed
```

This is a **comprehensive ResourceQuota**, which:
- Limits the aggregate requests and limits for CPU and memory across all resources within the namespace.
- Provides precise control over resource allocation, preventing a single container or application from consuming too many resources.
- Is ideal when you want to enforce both **specific resource allocations and limits on object counts** within a namespace.

#### When to Use This:
- When you need to control both **total resource usage** (CPU/memory) and **object counts** (pods, services, replication controllers) in the namespace.
- Suitable for production environments where balancing resource usage across multiple workloads or teams is crucial.

### 2. ResourceQuota with Scope and PriorityClass (Second Definition)

This configuration is scoped to apply only to resources that have a specific **PriorityClass** (in this case, `medium`). The scope restricts the ResourceQuota to only those pods assigned to the specified PriorityClass:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ResourceQuota
metadata:
  name: pods-medium
spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "10"                     # Max CPU limit across pods with "medium" priority class
    memory: 20Gi                  # Max memory limit across pods with "medium" priority class
    pods: "10"                    # Max number of pods with "medium" priority class
  scopeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - operator: In
      scopeName: PriorityClass
      values: ["medium"]          # Apply quota only to pods with "medium" PriorityClass
```

This type of **scoped ResourceQuota** allows you to control resources based on a specific criterion, such as `PriorityClass`. Here:
- `cpu` and `memory` set the maximum resources allowed specifically for pods with the `PriorityClass` "medium."
- It’s not using `requests` or `limits` directly; instead, it aggregates total `cpu` and `memory` across all qualifying pods.

#### When to Use This:
- When you want to control resources for a **specific subset of pods** based on certain characteristics, such as priority, to prioritize or deprioritize workloads.
- Useful in environments with **multiple workload priorities** (e.g., high, medium, low) to ensure critical workloads always get necessary resources.

### Summary: `requests.cpu` vs. `cpu`

- **`requests.cpu` and `limits.cpu`**: Used when you need finer control over both requested and maximum CPU or memory allocations across all pods in a namespace. It enforces a limit on the sum of resource requests and limits.
- **`cpu` (or just `memory`)**: Sets an overall cap for a specific set of pods without separating requests from limits. This is broader and commonly used in **scoped ResourceQuotas** for specific subsets, like by `PriorityClass`.

### Which to Use?

- Use **`requests.cpu` and `limits.cpu` quotas** when you want fine-grained control for general-purpose environments with multiple containers, workloads, or teams, as these ensure resources are adequately allocated and balanced across the namespace.
- Use **scoped ResourceQuotas** when you have special workloads that need unique attention, like by priority level. This allows for greater flexibility in meeting the needs of different classes of workloads within the same cluster.
