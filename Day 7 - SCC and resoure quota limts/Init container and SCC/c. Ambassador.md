**Ambassador Sidecar Containers (SCCs)** are used when you want to manage and control access to external or internal services within Kubernetes without exposing the main application container directly. They act as "gateways" or "proxies," handling requests from outside the Pod or cluster before they reach the main container. Ambassador SCCs typically route and transform requests, manage authentication, or provide load balancing.

### Common Use Cases for Ambassador SCCs

1. **Service-to-External Service Access**: When a main container needs to connect to an external API or database, an Ambassador sidecar can act as a proxy, managing network requests, enforcing security protocols, and handling retries or circuit breaking. This is especially useful in secure environments where direct access is restricted.

2. **Internal Service Routing**: Ambassador sidecars can route requests between internal microservices. In multi-tenant environments, they allow each microservice to communicate via a central sidecar that standardizes access rules and simplifies traffic management.

3. **API Gateway in the Pod**: In some cases, an Ambassador sidecar acts as an in-cluster API gateway that handles request transformation, logging, or caching. This setup helps offload work from the main container and keeps it focused on its core functionality.

4. **Protocol Transformation and Request Enrichment**: Ambassador SCCs are often used to transform protocols (e.g., converting HTTP to HTTPS or gRPC) and enrich requests by adding headers or metadata. This is common in scenarios where services expect requests in specific formats or with specific authentication tokens.

### Example: Ambassador SCC for a Database Connection

Suppose a main application container interacts with a database. Instead of exposing the database connection directly, you could set up an Ambassador sidecar:

- **Secure Connection Management**: The Ambassador SCC can handle SSL/TLS encryption for the database connection, adding an extra layer of security.
- **Connection Pooling**: It can maintain a pool of connections, optimizing database performance and reducing the burden on the main container.
- **Failover Handling**: If the primary database is down, the sidecar can reroute traffic to a secondary instance, providing failover capabilities that enhance resilience.

### Benefits of Using Ambassador Sidecars

- **Modularity**: Keeps the main container's responsibilities focused and allows the Ambassador to handle peripheral concerns like security, transformation, and routing.
- **Security and Compliance**: Ambassador SCCs provide a layer of abstraction, which can be configured to enforce security standards and compliance requirements.
- **Enhanced Observability**: Ambassador sidecars can add tracing, logging, and metrics for outbound and inbound requests, giving better insight into the traffic going to the main container.

Ambassador SCCs are especially beneficial in microservices architectures, where you need a reliable, secure way to manage traffic and access to services without modifying the core application logic.
