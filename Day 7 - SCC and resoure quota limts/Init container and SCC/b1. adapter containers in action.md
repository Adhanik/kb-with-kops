## Init container
- We will be genrating yaml manifest for our adapter container

`kubectl create deployment adapter-container-demo --image nginx --replicas 3 --dry-run -o yaml`

- We are cloning this repo to /html

args: ["-c", "git clone https://github.com/saikiranpi/Sidecar_Test.git /html"]

- We are mounting nginxvol to /html dir inside the init-container

## Adapter container

for adatper container, we are writing todays date to index.html

args: ["-c", "while true; do echo \\<h1\\>$(date)\\</h1\\> >> /html/index.html; sleep 5;done"]. we have index.html file in the git repo we cloned above, and the repo we have cloned is kept inside /html , hence /html/index.html


## Service

We have defined a service as well in our yaml, and as niginx operates on port 80, we have exposed the service on port 80 using NodePort

As soon as we kubectl apply -f adapter.yaml, we can see our deployment is created.

```

kubectl get deployment
NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
adapter-container-demo   1/1     1            1           10s

```

We can see our pods is up and running along with service exposed on port 32261
```

ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~/init$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
adapter-container-demo-867ffbc8b6-m4g5n   2/2     Running   0          3m2s
ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~/init$ kubectl get svc
NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
adapter-container-demo   NodePort    100.65.185.86   <none>        80:32261/TCP   13m
kubernetes               ClusterIP   100.64.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        4h12m
ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~/init$ 
```

Now add 32261 in inbound rules of control plane EC2, and we will be able to see our applicatoin up and running, along with time printed out on <PUBILC IP OF EC2>:32261

# Exec inside the continaer

We can see if the ouput is being populated inside our container as well 

```

ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
adapter-container-demo-867ffbc8b6-m4g5n   2/2     Running   0          56m
ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl exec -it adapter-container-demo-867ffbc8b6-m4g5n  -- sh
Defaulted container "adapter-container" out of: adapter-container, main-container, init-container (init)
/ # ls
bin   dev   etc   home  html  proc  root  sys   tmp   usr   var
/ # cd /html
/html # ls
index.html
/html # cat index.html 
```

# Clean up

```

ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl delete deployment.apps adapter-container-demo
deployment.apps "adapter-container-demo" deleted

ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl get svc

kubernetes               ClusterIP   100.64.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        5h10m
ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl delete svc adapter-container-demo
service "adapter-container-demo" deleted
ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ 

```

Next we will be deploying a single yaml file which will consist of our both init container task and adapter tasks along with main container.

After we do, kubectl apply -f initadapter.yaml, we see our deployment is created and pod is up and running.

```

kubectl get deployments
NAME                     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
adapter-container-demo   1/1     1            1           2m32s

ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl get pods

adapter-container-demo-cd6bff4c8-r75qb   2/2     Running   0          2m36s

ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ kubectl get svc

kubernetes                  ClusterIP   100.64.0.1      <none>        443/TCP        5h33m
myservice                   NodePort    100.70.46.80    <none>        80:32188/TCP   94s
ubuntu@ip-172-31-26-73:~$ 

```

# Containers running

To see all the containers that are running inside our pod, we will do 

`kubectl exec -it adapter-container-demo-cd6bff4c8-r75qb -- sh`
```

Defaulted container "adapter-container" out of: adapter-container, main-container, wait-for-service (init), perform-task (init)
/ # ls -al
/html cat index.html
<h1>Tue Oct 29 13:33:43 UTC 2024</h1>
<h1>Tue Oct 29 13:33:48 UTC 2024</h1>
<h1>Tue Oct 29 13:33:53 UTC 2024</h1>
/html # cat status.txt 
Init-container tasks completed
/html # 

```

We can see the status msg from init container is executed successfully as well as from adapter container.

# Clean up

```
 kubectl delete deployment.apps adapter-container-demo
deployment.apps "adapter-container-demo" deleted

```

Delete svc

```
kubectl get svc
