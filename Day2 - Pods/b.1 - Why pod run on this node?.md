In Kubernetes, Pods are scheduled on worker nodes, not control-plane (master) nodes, unless the control-plane node is tainted to allow workloads to run on it (which is typically not recommended). Based on your setup, you have:

- **2 worker nodes** (`i-0401ab05e63feb772` and `i-0c86e68dd92f450ce`)
- **1 control-plane node** (`i-07d85eb02719ceecd`)

### Pod Scheduling:
- The Pod `alpha1` is running on the worker node `i-0c86e68dd92f450ce` (as seen from the `kubectl get pods -o wide` output).
- Kubernetes schedules Pods across available worker nodes based on various factors such as node resources (CPU, memory), affinity/anti-affinity rules, taints/tolerations, and others.
- **Kops doesn't control scheduling directly** but ensures the cluster nodes and control plane are set up properly. The **Kubernetes scheduler** determines where to place Pods based on the cluster's state.

### Will the Pod Run on Both Worker Nodes?
- By default, a Pod (like `alpha1`) will run on a **single node**, not on multiple nodes. If you want the same Pod to run on multiple nodes for high availability or load balancing, you should use a **Deployment** or **ReplicaSet**, which allows Kubernetes to manage multiple replicas of a Pod across nodes.

For example, if you want to ensure `alpha1` runs on both worker nodes, you can modify the YAML to create a Deployment with replicas:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: alpha1
  namespace: alpha
spec:
  replicas: 2  # Number of replicas (2 in this case, one for each worker node)
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      run: alpha1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        run: alpha1
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: kiran2361993/kubegame:v2
        name: alpha1
```

This way, Kubernetes will create two replicas of the Pod, and they can be scheduled on different worker nodes, depending on resource availability.

### Why is the Pod Running on a Specific Node?
The scheduler decides which worker node to place the Pod on by evaluating factors such as:
- **Resource availability**: Kubernetes will try to balance CPU and memory usage across nodes.
- **Affinity/anti-affinity rules**: You can define these rules to influence how Pods are distributed across nodes.
- **Taints and tolerations**: If a node has taints, only Pods that tolerate those taints will be scheduled on it.
- **NodeSelector/Node Affinity**: If you specify `nodeSelector` or `node affinity` in your Pod spec, it will influence which node the Pod gets scheduled on.

Since you didnâ€™t specify any such constraints, the scheduler automatically placed the Pod on one of the available worker nodes (`i-0c86e68dd92f450ce` in this case).

### Conclusion:
- The Pod is running on a single worker node (`i-0c86e68dd92f450ce`).
- If you want to distribute it across both worker nodes, use a Deployment with multiple replicas.
- The scheduler handles Pod placement based on available resources and configuration options like taints, node affinity, etc.
