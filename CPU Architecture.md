# CAN you explain me what this architecture is ? like are all laptops computer in world follow this x86 or arm64 only? and why the name is absure x86?? what does it signify?

The terms **x86-64** (also known as **AMD64**) and **ARM64** refer to computer **processor architectures**, which define how a processor handles instructions from the operating system and applications. These architectures influence hardware performance, power efficiency, and software compatibility.

### 1. **What is x86-64 (AMD64)?**

- **x86-64** is an extension of the earlier **x86** architecture, originally developed by **Intel**.
- **x86** (or more formally, Intel 8086) was introduced in the 1970s and was designed as a 16-bit architecture.
- Over time, it evolved to support 32-bit processing (called **IA-32**) and later, **64-bit** processing, which led to **x86-64**.
- This architecture is primarily used in **desktop computers, laptops, and servers** from companies like Intel and AMD.

### Why the name **x86**?

- The **"x86"** name comes from the model numbers of early Intel processors, which ended in "86" (e.g., Intel 8086, 80286, 80386).
- As the architecture evolved, it retained the "x86" designation, even though modern chips are far more powerful than the original 8086 processors.
- **x86-64** is just the 64-bit extension of the earlier x86 architecture.

### 2. **What is ARM64?**

- **ARM64** (or **AArch64**) refers to the **64-bit version of the ARM architecture**. ARM stands for **Advanced RISC Machine**.
- ARM chips are designed using a **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)** architecture, which simplifies the instructions a CPU can execute, improving power efficiency.
- ARM processors are commonly found in **smartphones, tablets, IoT devices**, and increasingly in **laptops** (e.g., Apple’s M1/M2 chips in MacBooks and some Windows laptops).
  
### x86-64 vs. ARM64:

- **x86-64** is widely used in **traditional desktops, laptops, and servers**, providing high performance for tasks like gaming, content creation, and enterprise applications.
- **ARM64** is used in **mobile devices, embedded systems, and newer laptops** (like Apple’s MacBooks with M1/M2 chips) due to its **power efficiency** and lower heat generation. This is important for battery-powered devices.

### 3. **Are all laptops/computers x86 or ARM64?**

- **Most laptops and desktop computers today** either use **x86-64** or **ARM64** architectures.
  - Historically, **Intel and AMD** dominated the desktop and laptop market with **x86-64**.
  - In recent years, **ARM64** has gained popularity, especially with **Apple's transition to ARM chips (M1/M2)** in their MacBooks and other vendors experimenting with ARM-based laptops (like Microsoft's Surface Pro X).
  
### 4. **Why the name "x86" seems obscure?**

- The term "x86" may seem outdated or obscure because it originated from the naming convention of Intel processors in the 1970s and 1980s, which ended with "86".
- Even though technology has advanced significantly, the term persists due to its legacy. It remains widely used because modern processors are still **compatible** with older x86 instructions, ensuring backward compatibility for software.

### Conclusion:

- **x86-64** and **ARM64** are the two dominant architectures today, with x86-64 historically strong in desktops/servers and ARM64 leading in mobile devices and power-efficient laptops.
- The names reflect the **legacy and history** of these processor architectures: **x86** for Intel's historical processor numbering and **ARM** for its focus on power-efficient design.

### so intel is x86 and amd manages arm64?

Actually, **both Intel and AMD** are primarily associated with the **x86** architecture, not ARM64. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

### **Intel and AMD: x86-64 (AMD64)**

- **Intel** developed the original **x86** architecture back in the 1970s. This architecture became the foundation for modern PCs.
- **AMD** later extended the x86 architecture to 64-bit with its own version, which is known as **AMD64**. Even though it was created by AMD, this 64-bit extension of x86 is also used by **Intel**. As a result, both Intel and AMD processors today use the **x86-64** (or **AMD64**) architecture.
  
### **ARM64: ARM Holdings**

- **ARM64** is managed by a different company: **ARM Holdings**. ARM licenses its architecture to other manufacturers (like **Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung**, and others) to design their own processors.
  - For example, Apple's **M1/M2** chips in MacBooks, as well as **Qualcomm Snapdragon** processors in smartphones, are based on the ARM architecture.
  - **Intel and AMD do not design ARM processors**, though some ARM-based chips have been used in specific devices like tablets and embedded systems.

### Intel, AMD, and ARM

- **Intel** and **AMD**: Both are known for designing processors based on the **x86-64** architecture, which is dominant in **desktops, laptops, and servers**.
- **ARM Holdings**: ARM designs the **ARM64** architecture, which is known for its **power efficiency** and is used in **smartphones, tablets, and more recently, laptops** (e.g., Apple’s MacBooks and some Windows laptops).

### Key Points:

- **Intel and AMD** are rivals in the **x86-64 (AMD64)** space, designing chips for PCs, laptops, and servers.
- **ARM** is used by a variety of manufacturers (like Apple, Qualcomm, and others) for **mobile devices** and low-power applications.
  
Intel has explored making ARM-based chips in the past, but its main products are still x86-64. AMD is similar in that it primarily focuses on x86-64 architecture and competes directly with Intel in that space.

### Summary:
- **x86-64**: Used by **Intel** and **AMD**.
- **ARM64**: Designed by **ARM Holdings** and used by companies like **Apple** (M1/M2), **Qualcomm** (Snapdragon), and others.
