# Dynamically Applying Application Configurations in Kubernetes

Yes, application configurations such as environment variables and ConfigMap updates can be applied dynamically without recreating the pod, but it depends on how the application is designed to handle such updates.

## Scenario 1: Using ConfigMaps as Environment Variables (Requires Pod Restart)

When a ConfigMap is mounted as environment variables, any update to the ConfigMap requires a pod restart because environment variables are set only at container startup.

### Example:

1. **Create a ConfigMap**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: my-config
   data:
     APP_MODE: "production"
   ```

2. **Use it in a deployment**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-container
           image: busybox
           command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo $APP_MODE && sleep 3600"]
           env:
           - name: APP_MODE
             valueFrom:
               configMapKeyRef:
                 name: my-config
                 key: APP_MODE
   ```

3. **Update the ConfigMap**:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit configmap my-config
   ```
   After modifying `APP_MODE`, the running pod will **not** see the change immediately. You must restart the pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl rollout restart deployment my-app
   ```

## Scenario 2: Mounting ConfigMaps as Volumes (Dynamic Updates)

If a ConfigMap is mounted as a volume inside a container, updates to the ConfigMap are reflected dynamically without needing to restart the pod.

### Example:

1. **Modify the ConfigMap**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: ConfigMap
   metadata:
     name: my-config
   data:
     config.json: |
       {
         "app_mode": "production"
       }
   ```

2. **Mount it in a pod**:
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: apps/v1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: my-app
   spec:
     replicas: 1
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: my-app
     template:
       metadata:
         labels:
           app: my-app
       spec:
         containers:
         - name: my-container
           image: busybox
           command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "while true; do cat /config/config.json; sleep 5; done"]
           volumeMounts:
           - name: config-volume
             mountPath: "/config"
             readOnly: true
         volumes:
         - name: config-volume
           configMap:
             name: my-config
   ```

3. **Update the ConfigMap**:
   ```bash
   kubectl edit configmap my-config
   ```
   Modify `config.json`, and the changes will be reflected inside the pod automatically within a few seconds.

**Caveat**: The application must be designed to reload the file dynamically. If it reads the config only once at startup, it won’t see the updates.

## Scenario 3: Using the Downward API for Pod Metadata Updates

You can also use the Downward API to dynamically expose pod metadata as environment variables or files, but like ConfigMap env vars, they require a restart to take effect.

## Best Practices

- **For environment variables** → Restart the pod (immutable)
- **For ConfigMap volume mounts** → Works dynamically if the app watches for changes
- **For secrets** → Similar behavior, but updates take longer (~1 min)
