We have two types of Node Affinity -


## match expression

These help to acheive advance configurable scheduling for pods on nodes. The labels mentioned in matchExpressions are key value pairs assigned to nodes

## labeling node

For assigining label to node 

`kubectl label node i-02323f017dd4c7124 env=one`

`kubectl label node i-029794074e62f032e env=two`

`kubectl label node i-088f8968e40a0732c env=three`

Once we have labelled the nodes, now we will specify in deployment manifest where the pods should be deployed.
The required hard will not be deployed any where else, whereas the preferred soft, if node is not free, will be deployed on other nodes.


## required-hard

For required-hard, if the matchExpressions are not matching, its not going to allow deployment to deploy any pods on the cluster. If you want your pods to be deployed strictly on a specific node, then you can use required-hard Node Affinity

Eg - Schedule a pod only on nodes labeled with disktype=ssd.

```yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: ssd-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:  # Hard requirement
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: disktype
            operator: In
            values:
            - ssd

```

### Explanation:

- The pod must be scheduled on nodes labeled disktype=ssd.
- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: Hard ruleâ€”if no matching node exists, the pod won't be scheduled.


## preferred-soft

If for some reason, you dont want the pod to have constraints, that is, if somehow the pods cannot be deployed on a specific node, but you still want them to be able to deploy on some other nodes, the we can go for preferred-soft.


## Procedure

Before deploying these, we need to assign the labels properly. Refer above for label.


`kubectl create deployment required-hard --image=nginx --replicas=4 --dry-run=client -o yaml`
```
kubectl label node i-02323f017dd4c7124 env=one
node/i-02323f017dd4c7124 labeled
```
```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-21-109:~$ kubectl label node i-029794074e62f032e env=two
node/i-029794074e62f032e labeled
```
```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-21-109:~$ kubectl label node i-088f8968e40a0732c env=three
node/i-088f8968e40a0732c labeled

```

We have deployed deployment with labels having env=one and env=two, and we can see that pods are deployed on that nodes only.

```
kubectl get pods -o wide
