Next we have NoExecute.

What happens if we label our node with NoExecute? As soon as you mark a node with NoExecute, all the pods running on that node are evicted, and a deployment having toleration of NoExecute will only be deployed on that node.

## Create deployment

We will create a deployment first, and then taint nodes with NoExecute
`kubectl create deployment amit --image=nginx:latest --replicas=3`

```
kubectl get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amit-7dcb78985c-6ffzj   1/1     Running   0          7s
amit-7dcb78985c-c8tc2   1/1     Running   0          7s
amit-7dcb78985c-k4nxs   1/1     Running   0          7s

```

## Taint the nodes

We will taint the nodes 

`kubectl taint nodes i-0ae49c553dd44dbe6 high-cpu=yes:NoExecute`
`kubectl taint nodes i-0e8a5897b99e4741d mid-cpu=yes:NoExecute`
`kubectl taint nodes i-0f302835d89b26b7d low-cpu=yes:NoExecute`


## O/P

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-169:~$ kubectl taint nodes i-0ae49c553dd44dbe6 high-cpu=yes:NoExecute
node/i-0ae49c553dd44dbe6 tainted
ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-169:~$ kubectl taint nodes i-0e8a5897b99e4741d mid-cpu=yes:NoExecute
node/i-0e8a5897b99e4741d tainted
ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-169:~$ kubectl taint nodes i-0f302835d89b26b7d low-cpu=yes:NoExecute
node/i-0f302835d89b26b7d tainted
```

We can see the pods went in Pending state. NoExecute makes sure that the current pods are evicted and no future pods without toleration are allowed to run.

```
ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-169:~$ kubectl get pods
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
amit-7dcb78985c-8rxqw   0/1     Pending   0          3s
amit-7dcb78985c-szkrw   0/1     Pending   0          3s
amit-7dcb78985c-tznbf   0/1     Pending   0          3s
ubuntu@ip-172-31-30-169:~$ 

```

Now if we deploy with toleration using toleration.yaml, we can see that pods are running

```
app2-58f5b64b48-4sbkd   1/1     Running   0          11s
app2-58f5b64b48-d6wm6   1/1     Running   0          11s
app2-58f5b64b48-n4hkf   1/1     Running   0          11s

app2-58f5b64b48-zp4t5   1/1     Running   0          11s

```
