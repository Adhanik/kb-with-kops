## **Key Terms in Node Affinity**

### **1. `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`:**  
- **Purpose**: Specifies **hard rules** for scheduling.  
- If the rules are **not met**, the pod will **stay pending** and won't be scheduled until a matching node is available.  
- **"Required" means mandatory.**  

#### **IgnoredDuringExecution**:  
- This means the node affinity rule is **only checked during scheduling**.  
- After the pod is scheduled, **changes in the node's labels are ignored**, and the pod **won't be evicted** if the node's labels change later.

---

#### **Example: Hard Rule**
```yaml
requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
  nodeSelectorTerms:
  - matchExpressions:
    - key: environment
      operator: In
      values:
      - prod
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - Pod will be scheduled **only on nodes** labeled `environment=prod`.  
  - If no such node exists, the pod remains **`Pending`** until a matching node appears.  

---

### **2. `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`:**  
- **Purpose**: Specifies **soft rules** for scheduling.  
- If the preferred rules **cannot be satisfied**, the pod is still scheduled to **other available nodes** that don’t meet the preference.  
- **"Preferred" means optional.**  

#### **IgnoredDuringExecution**:  
- Similar to `required`, this is **only evaluated during scheduling** and **ignored later**.  
- The pod is **not evicted** if the node labels change after the pod is running.

---

#### **Example: Soft Rule**
```yaml
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- weight: 1
  preference:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: environment
      operator: In
      values:
      - dev
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - Pod **prefers nodes** labeled `environment=dev`, but it can **fall back** to other nodes if no such node exists.  
  - The `weight: 1` means this preference has a **priority score of 1** (higher weight = higher priority).

---

### **3. What is `weight`?**

- **Purpose**: Defines the **priority** of a preference rule.  
- Value ranges from **1 to 100**.  
- **Higher weight = higher priority.**  

#### **Example with Multiple Preferences**:
```yaml
preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
- weight: 50
  preference:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: cpu
      operator: In
      values:
      - high
- weight: 10
  preference:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: zone
      operator: In
      values:
      - us-east-1a
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - Kubernetes will **prefer nodes** with `cpu=high` (weight 50).  
  - If no such node is available, it will then look for nodes in `zone=us-east-1a` (weight 10).  
  - Nodes satisfying **both preferences** score higher and are **preferred first**.

---

### **4. What is `operator`?**

The **`operator`** defines how the label key and value are matched.  

| Operator    | Description                                                                                      | Example                                                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`In`**    | Matches nodes where the label value is **in the specified list of values**.                      | `key: environment, values: [prod, dev]` → Matches `environment=prod`.  |
| **`NotIn`** | Matches nodes where the label value is **not in the specified list of values**.                  | `key: zone, values: [us-east-1a]` → Excludes `zone=us-east-1a`.         |
| **`Exists`**| Matches nodes where the **label key exists**, regardless of value.                               | `key: environment` → Matches nodes with **any value** for `environment`.|
| **`DoesNotExist`**| Matches nodes where the **label key does not exist**.                                      | `key: gpu` → Matches nodes **without a gpu label**.                     |
| **`Gt`**    | Matches nodes where the label value is **greater than a specified value** (numeric only).        | `key: memory, values: [16]` → Matches `memory=32`.                      |
| **`Lt`**    | Matches nodes where the label value is **less than a specified value** (numeric only).           | `key: memory, values: [16]` → Matches `memory=8`.                       |

### **5. Combining Required and Preferred Rules**

You can **combine both rules** for stricter and fallback behavior:  

```yaml
affinity:
  nodeAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      nodeSelectorTerms:
      - matchExpressions:
        - key: environment
          operator: In
          values:
          - prod
    preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
    - weight: 20
      preference:
        matchExpressions:
        - key: cpu
          operator: In
          values:
          - high
```

- **Explanation**:  
  1. Pod **must match** `environment=prod`.  
  2. It **prefers nodes** with `cpu=high` but will still be scheduled if no such node is available.

### **Summary Table**

| Feature                                     | Required                                                   | Preferred                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Behavior**                                | **Mandatory**—Pod will **not be scheduled** if criteria fail.| **Optional**—Pod **can fall back** to other nodes if needed.|
| **Key Usage**                               | Use when **strict placement** is required (e.g., high-performance nodes).| Use when there’s a **preferred node** but fallback is allowed.|
| **Weight**                                  | **Not applicable**—Rules are strictly enforced.            | **Weight (1–100)** determines preference priority.        |
| **Operators Supported**                     | `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, `DoesNotExist`, `Gt`, `Lt`        | Same as required (`In`, `NotIn`, etc.)                    |
| **Pod Behavior if Labels Change After Scheduling** | Ignored (pod won’t be evicted).                            | Ignored (pod won’t be evicted).                           |

### **When to Use?**

1. **Use `requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`** when:  
   - Strict placement rules are **non-negotiable**.  
   - Example: Deploy a **database** that must run on **SSD storage nodes**.  

2. **Use `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution`** when:  
   - You have a **preferred node**, but fallback is acceptable.  
   - Example: Deploy a **frontend app** that **prefers high-performance nodes** but can run on others if required.
