# Node selector

When you want to deploy a pod or replicas on specific node, then we make use of Node selector attribute. Eg - Suppose your deployment consists of 3 replicas, then all the 3 pods will be deployed on node which you have specified in node selector.

In Node selector, you can only pass one argument at a time, you cannot pass multiple expression. In node affinity, you can pass multiple expression.


## **Node Selector vs Node Affinity**  

### **1. Node Selector**  
- **Purpose**: Schedule pods on nodes that match specific **labels**.  
- **Usage**: Simple scenarios where you only need to assign pods to nodes with a specific label.  

### **Key Features**:  
- Works as a **key-value match**.  
- **Only supports exact matches** (no complex rules).  
- Cannot define multiple conditions or expressions.  

### **Example**:  
#### Add a label to the node:  
```bash
kubectl label nodes node1 environment=prod
```

#### Define a Pod using `nodeSelector`:  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: prod-pod
spec:
  nodeSelector:
    environment: prod # Match label "environment=prod"
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

- This Pod will **only be scheduled** on nodes labeled `environment=prod`.  
- If no such node exists, the pod will remain in a **`Pending`** state.

---

### **When to Use Node Selector**:  
- Simple use cases where **only one condition** needs to be matched.  
- Example: Deploy database pods only on nodes labeled as `database=true`.  
- Limitations: Cannot handle complex expressions like **OR, AND, ranges, or weights**.

---

### **2. Node Affinity**  
- **Purpose**: Schedule pods based on **complex rules** and **conditions** for node selection.  
- **Usage**: Advanced scenarios where pods need to be placed based on multiple expressions or soft preferences.  

### **Key Features**:  
- Supports **multiple expressions** (AND/OR conditions).  
- Allows both **required** (hard rules) and **preferred** (soft rules) constraints.  
- More flexible than `nodeSelector`.

---

### **Example 1: Hard Rule (Required)**  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: critical-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchExpressions:
          - key: environment
            operator: In
            values:
            - prod
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - The pod **must** be scheduled only on nodes with the label `environment=prod`.  
  - If no such node exists, the pod will **stay pending**.  
  - Use this when placement **must strictly match** criteria (e.g., high-performance nodes).

---

### **Example 2: Soft Rule (Preferred)**  
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: non-critical-pod
spec:
  affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - weight: 1
        preference:
          matchExpressions:
          - key: environment
            operator: In
            values:
            - dev
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
```

- **Explanation**:  
  - The pod **prefers** nodes labeled `environment=dev`.  
  - However, if no such node exists, it can still be scheduled on **other nodes**.  
  - Use this when placement preference exists but is **not mandatory** (e.g., non-critical workloads).

### **Key Differences: Node Selector vs Node Affinity**

| Feature                     | Node Selector                        | Node Affinity                                         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Complex Expressions**      | No (Only key-value match)            | Yes (Supports AND, OR, ranges, weights)              |
| **Multiple Conditions**      | No                                  | Yes                                                  |
| **Required vs Preferred**    | No distinction                      | Supports **required** (hard) and **preferred** (soft)|
| **Use Case**                 | Simple, single-label matching        | Complex rules or fallback preferences               |
| **Flexibility**              | Low                                  | High                                                 |
| **Pod Scheduling Behavior**  | If the label doesnâ€™t match, pod is **pending**. | If required fails, pod is **pending**; else prefers fallback. |

### **When to Use Which?**

1. **Node Selector**:  
   - Use when you only need **simple rules** like "place on nodes with `gpu=true`".  
   - Suitable for small-scale clusters with **static labels**.  

2. **Node Affinity**:  
   - Use when you need **complex rules** like:  
     - "Place on high-performance nodes with labels `cpu=high` AND `memory=large`."  
     - "Prefer nodes with `zone=us-east-1a` but fallback to other zones if not available."  
   - Suitable for **large-scale clusters** requiring **flexible scheduling**.

---

### **Practical Use Case**:  

- **Scenario**:  
  - Critical database pods need **SSD storage** and **high CPU**.  
  - Non-critical applications can run on general-purpose nodes.  

- **Solution**:  
  1. Label nodes with required attributes:  
     ```bash
     kubectl label nodes node1 storage=ssd
     kubectl label nodes node2 cpu=high
     ```
  2. Apply **Node Affinity** for database pods:  
     ```yaml
     affinity:
       nodeAffinity:
         requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
           nodeSelectorTerms:
           - matchExpressions:
             - key: storage
               operator: In
               values:
               - ssd
     ```
  3. Apply **Node Selector** for general pods:  
     ```yaml
     nodeSelector:
       cpu: high
     ```

---

### **Final Notes**:

- Use **Node Selector** for **simple static rules** where labels are predefined.  
- Use **Node Affinity** for **complex requirements** that need both mandatory and optional constraints.  
- For more dynamic or load-based scheduling, consider **taints and tolerations** or **pod affinity/anti-affinity**.  

This updated explanation includes detailed examples, a clear table, and practical use cases for both methods to make it beginner-friendly and applicable in real-world scenarios.
